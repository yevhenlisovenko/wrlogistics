## 4. Data Collection on our Website

**Cookies**  
Our website uses cookies. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not contain viruses. Cookies serve to make our offerings more user-friendly, effective, and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.  
Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies." They are automatically deleted after your visit. Other cookies remain stored on your device until you delete them. These cookies enable us to recognize your browser the next time you visit.

You can set your browser so that you are informed about the setting of cookies and only allow cookies in individual cases, exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or generally, and activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. When deactivating cookies, the functionality of this website may be limited.  
The legal basis for processing personal data using cookies is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in storing cookies for the technically error-free and optimized provision of its services. Insofar as other cookies (e.g., cookies for analyzing your surfing behavior) are stored, these are treated separately in this privacy policy.

**Cookiebot**  
On our website, a web service of the company Cybot A/S, Havnegade 39, 1058 Copenhagen (hereinafter: cookiebot.com) is loaded. We use this data to ensure the full functionality of our website. In this context, your browser may transmit personal data to cookiebot.com. The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 para.1 lit. f GDPR. The legitimate interest exists in the error-free function of the internet site. The data is deleted as soon as the purpose of its collection has been fulfilled. Further information on the handling of the transferred data can be found in the privacy policy of cookiebot.com: https://www.cookiebot.com/en/privacy-policy/. You can prevent the collection and processing of your data by cookiebot.com by disabling the execution of script code in your browser or installing a script blocker in your browser (you can find this, for example, at www.noscript.net or www.ghostery.com).

The following information is stored in our Cookiebot account:

The IP address of the user in anonymized form (the last three digits are set to "0").  
Date and time of consent.  
User's browser.  
The URL from which the consent was sent.  
An anonymous, random, and encrypted key value.  
The consent state of the user, which serves as proof of consent.  
The key and consent status are also stored in the user's browser in the "CookieConsent" cookie, so that the website can automatically read and respect the user's consent for all subsequent page requests and future user sessions for up to 12 months. You have the option to view and change your consent level at any time. You can find this further down on this page.

This website uses cookies. We use cookies to personalise content and ads, to provide social media features and to analyse our traffic. We also share information about your use of our site with our social media, advertising and analytics partners who may combine it with other information that you've provided to them or that they've collected from your use of their services. 

**Server Log Files**  
The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:  
• Browser type and browser version  
• Operating system used  
• Referrer URL  
• Hostname of the accessing computer  
• Time of the server request  
• IP address

This data is not merged with other data sources.  
The basis for data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR, which permits the processing of data for the fulfillment of a contract or pre-contractual measures.

**Contact Form**  
If you send us inquiries via the contact form, your details from the inquiry form, including the contact data you provided there, will be stored by us for the purpose of processing the inquiry and in case of follow-up questions. We do not pass on this data without your consent.

The processing of the data entered in the contact form is therefore exclusively based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can revoke this consent at any time. For this, an informal email notification to us is sufficient. The legality of the data processing operations carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.

The data you entered in the contact form will remain with us until you request us to delete it, revoke your consent to store it, or the purpose for storing the data no longer applies (e.g., after your request has been processed). Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular retention periods - remain unaffected.

**SSL Encryption**  
This site uses SSL encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as requests you send to us as the site operator, in conjunction with the highest encryption level supported by your browser. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line. If SSL encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.

## 5. Analysis Tools and Advertising

**Google Analytics**  
Our website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service of Google Inc. ("Google Building Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland"). Google Analytics uses cookies that allow an analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there.

**The following data is stored:**  
• IP address with the last three digits of the user's calling system masked (anonymized)  
• Visited web pages  
• Your behavior on the pages  
• Your approximate location (country and city)  
• Referrer URL  
• Subpages accessed from the accessed page  
• Duration of stay on the website  
• Frequency of visiting the website

The software is set up so that the IP addresses are not stored completely, but the last three digits of the IP address are masked (e.g.: 192.168.79.***). In this way, it is not possible for the responsible website operator to assign the shortened IP address to the calling computer or end device of the user.

The processing of the user's personal data with the help of Google Analytics enables us to analyze the surfing behavior of the users. By evaluating the data obtained, we are able to compile information about the use of the individual components of our website. This helps us to continually improve our website and its user-friendliness.

The legal basis for the processing of personal data is the user's consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR.

The data processed by Google Analytics is processed in third countries. Google Inc. ensures that the parent company of the Google group of companies, Google LLC, remains certified itself and for its one hundred percent US subsidiaries in accordance with the Privacy Shield principles and that the scope of the Privacy Shield certification of Google LLC covers the personal data of the customer.

If you want to deactivate Google Analytics, you can download and install an add-on for your own web browser. The add-on for deactivating Google Analytics is compatible with the common versions of Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, and Opera. For the add-on to work, it must be correctly loaded and listed in the browser.

Our website uses plugins from the Google-operated website YouTube. The operator of the pages is YouTube, LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA.  
When you visit one of our pages equipped with a YouTube plugin, a connection to the YouTube servers is established. The YouTube server is informed which of our pages you have visited.

If you are logged into your YouTube account, you allow YouTube to associate your browsing behavior directly with your personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.

The use of YouTube is in the interest of an appealing presentation of our online offerings. This represents a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.

For this purpose, the browser you use must connect to Google's servers. As a result, Google becomes aware that our website was accessed via your IP address. The use of Google Web Fonts is in the interest of a uniform and appealing presentation of our online offerings. This represents a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.

If your browser does not support web fonts, a standard font from your computer is used.  
Further information about Google Web Fonts can be found at https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq and in Google's privacy policy: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.

**Google Maps**  
This site uses the map service Google Maps via an API. The provider is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.

To use the functions of Google Maps, it is necessary to store your IP address. This information is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. The provider of this site has no influence on this data transfer.

The use of Google Maps is in the interest of an appealing presentation of our online offerings and to make the locations specified by us on the website easy to find. This represents a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.
